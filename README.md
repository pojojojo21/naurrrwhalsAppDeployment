# project-naurrrwhals
Main repo for cis350/project-naurrrwhals. Contains the web app, as well as the wiki.

## Other repos

Our backend can be found at https://github.com/cis350/project-naurrrwhals-backend.

Our mobile app can be found at https://github.com/cis350/project-naurrrwhals-mobile.

Our deployed app can be found at https://naurrrwhals.herokuapp.com/.

## To Run

Run with `npm start` from the `naur_app` directory. 

The backend must also be running on the same machine. (It is probably more convenient to just run the backend on its own, which will automatically serve the frontend at the root.)

## Other branches

Unit and UI tests are located on the `all-tests` branch.

Cypress tests are located on the `cypress-tests` branch.
